1. Approaching the School
You stand at the edge of a sprawling forest clearing, the afternoon sun glinting off the spires of the grand castle ahead. SpellCraft, The School of Magic rises majestically, its walls shimmering faintly as if woven with enchantments. Smaller floating buildings drift lazily in the sky around it, tethered by glowing golden chains of light. The air hums with magic, and every step you take fills you with awe and anticipation.

2. The Explosion
Suddenly, a deafening boom shatters the tranquility, and a blinding green light erupts from the school’s central tower. Ripples of raw magical energy pulse outward, bending trees and sending a gust of wind that nearly knocks you off your feet. The floating buildings wobble precariously but remain aloft. The castle itself is still standing, but cracks and scorch marks now mar its once-perfect facade.

3. The Flying Wizard
As you try to make sense of what just happened, a figure is launched from one of the castle’s upper balconies, spiraling through the air like a shooting star in reverse. He plummets into a nearby bush with an undignified crash, the underbrush rustling as he lands with a muffled groan.

4. Helping the Wizard
You hurry over to the bush and find an older man tangled in its brambles. His blue cloak, adorned with tiny, glowing stars, is torn and smudged with dirt. His long white beard is singed at the tips, and he’s clutching a bright wand that flickers with unstable light.

“Ah, thank you, young one,” he mutters as you help him to his feet. His voice is warm but weary, a mixture of embarrassment and gratitude.

Using a mix of bandages and simple healing spells, you manage to patch him up. He straightens his cloak with a flourish, though the stars on it flicker unevenly.

5. Introducing Eldrin Starsworn
“I am Professor Eldrin Starsworn,” he says with a dramatic bow, wincing slightly as he does. “Instructor of all first-years and occasional victim of... experimental magical mishaps.” He chuckles, though there’s a nervous edge to it.

He gestures toward the castle, now visibly scarred by the explosion. “That,” he says, “was the result of an experiment in the Arcane Laboratory. Something went awry—a miscalculation, perhaps, or interference. It’s impossible to say for sure until we investigate further.”

6. The Urgency to Reach the School
His gaze grows serious as he turns back to you. “Whatever the cause, there may be damage beyond what we can see. We must make haste to the school and ensure everything—and everyone—is safe. I’ll need your help, young wizard.”

With that, Eldrin begins hobbling toward the castle, his cloak billowing dramatically behind him despite its tattered state.
