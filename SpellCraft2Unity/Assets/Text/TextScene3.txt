1. Waiting in the Auditorium
The auditorium is a blend of ancient enchantments and modern ingenuity. Gleaming chandeliers hang suspended in mid-air, casting a warm, golden glow. The walls shimmer faintly with protective wards, their runes pulsing rhythmically. Despite the damage scorched beams and cracked stone the room radiates a strange, comforting resilience.

Students sit clustered in nervous groups, their hushed conversations forming a low buzz. You take a seat, your eyes drawn to the intricate carvings on the walls and the stage at the front, waiting for the professor’s return.

2. Eldrin Appears
With a sudden crackle of energy, a blinding flash illuminates the stage. Eldrin emerges, his robe now mended and his demeanor commanding. He raises a hand, and the nervous chatter dies instantly. The entire room holds its breath as his voice echoes through the hall.

3. Eldrin Explains
“Students, listen well,” Eldrin begins, his voice heavy with urgency. “Earlier today, an experiment in the Arcane Laboratory went catastrophically awry. The explosion has caused damage throughout the school... but that is not our only concern.”

He pauses, his expression grave. “The professors investigating the event left us a note before venturing into the dungeon below. They haven’t returned. I fear something is preventing their escape, something dangerous.”

Gasps ripple through the crowd, and Eldrin raises a hand to quiet them. “We cannot leave them to their fate. I will need volunteers to aid in their rescue.” His gaze sweeps the room, lingering on the apprehensive faces before him.

4. Silence
The room falls utterly silent. Fear and uncertainty grip the students, their gazes fixed on the floor or darting nervously toward each other. Even the shimmering chandeliers seem dimmer in the tense atmosphere.

5. Does the Player Volunteer?
Eldrin scans the crowd, his eyes searching. Slowly, his gaze falls upon you. His brow furrows slightly, as though sensing something. Will you stand and answer the call?

6. Player Volunteers!
You rise to your feet, your voice steady despite the weight of the moment. “I’ll go.”

All eyes turn to you, a mix of surprise and admiration flickering in their expressions. Eldrin’s face lights up with approval. “Ah, a brave soul indeed,” he says, his tone filled with respect. “I could sense your potential from the moment we met. The magical energy within you is... remarkable.”

He turns to the rest of the students. “The rest of you, return to your dorms and await further instructions. Safety is paramount.”

Eldrin gestures for you to follow. “Come, young one. There’s much to prepare.”

7. Eldrin Gives the Map
In a quiet corner of the hall, Eldrin hands you an aged parchment. Its edges are frayed, and faint runes dance along its surface, glowing faintly as though alive.

“This map will be your guide,” he says, his tone solemn. “It is no ordinary map. It will show you the layout of the dungeon and alert you to the presence of monsters. Be cautious—the deeper you go, the stronger the foes will become. Study it well, and let it be your ally in the shadows below.”
