1. First things first

Eldrin gestures toward a narrow passage, leading you to a small chamber adjoining the spell library. At its center, the portal still swirls ominously, a reminder of the dangers ahead.

He stops in front of it, his expression serious. “This portal is volatile and unpredictable. It’s a gateway to the unknown, and its magic is not bound by the rules of this world. Do not underestimate the dangers beyond.”

Eldrin turns and leads you to the spell library. As you walk, he adds, “Follow me closely. The library holds what you’ll need to prepare."

2. The Spell Library
Eldrin leads you into the spell library, a vast chamber filled with towering shelves of glowing tomes and artifacts. Magical orbs float gently in the air, illuminating the room in soft, shifting hues.

“Here,” Eldrin says, gesturing to a table where a small selection of spell cards lies waiting. “These will be your tools in the dungeon. Each card carries immense power, but it must be wielded with precision.”

3. The Four Spell Cards
Eldrin picks up the first card, its surface pulsing with fiery red energy. “This is Incendius, a spell of magma and destruction. It can melt through even the sturdiest defenses.”

Next, he lifts a frosty blue card. “Tidal Cataclysm, a spell of ice and crushing tides. It freezes enemies in their tracks.”

The third card exudes a shadowy aura. “Call of the Void, chaos incarnate. It draws power from the unknown to devastate your foes.”

Finally, he holds a card etched with deep earthen tones. “And World Shaker, a spell of earth and upheaval. It will ground even the fiercest of opponents.”

He sets the cards before you. “Study these well. They are your key to survival.”

4. Onward and Outward

Eldrin steps back into the room where the portal churns ominously, its swirling energy unchanged since you first saw it. He turns to you, his expression a mixture of apprehension and determination.

“This is still our way forward,” he says, his tone firm. “Though the portal is unfamiliar, it’s the only path to the dungeon and the missing professors. Its appearance is a sign that powerful forces are stirring below.”

He takes a step aside, gesturing toward the portal. “When you’re ready, focus your energy and take the step. Trust your instincts to guide you through. Your magic will find the path.”

Placing a reassuring hand on your shoulder, Eldrin’s expression softens. “I will be with you through every step of this journey. I’ll teach you how to wield the spells and face what lies ahead. There’s nothing to fear, we’ll face it together.”
